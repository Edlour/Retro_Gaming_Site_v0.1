# Retro_Gaming_Site_v0.1
A website I created as a learning experience. It's basically a site that allows people to sign up, then download games. I wanted to keep it simple yet amazing. (Please keep in mind that this site is not actually functional, in terms of downloading the games! But the navbar does work!))
